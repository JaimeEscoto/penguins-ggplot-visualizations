## Project Overview

Pending to change

1. Installing librarie.

2. **Explore Data, Fields Convention:** Thoroughly examine the dataset, understand data distributions, and establish field conventions for consistency in data processing.

3. **Code in Python:** To Copy Data from CSV Files to Tables in Database: Develop Python scripts to efficiently transfer data from CSV files to corresponding tables in the SQLite database, ensuring seamless integration.

4. **Data Analysis:** Utilize SQL queries and Python libraries (e.g., pandas) for data analysis with the dataset.

5. **Tableau Integration:** In a recent enhancement, I introduced a Python script that seamlessly converts database data into a JSON file. This JSON file can now be effortlessly imported into Tableau, enabling the creation of dynamic visualizations. This addition not only enhances data accessibility but also serves as a powerful demonstration of the seamless integration capabilities between Python and Tableau in this project.

## Data Set

- **Data Source:** The dataset used in this project originates from the 'palmerpenguins' package within the 'tidyverse' ecosystem.
  `Code: library("palmerpenguins")`
- **Context:** It provides comprehensive information about penguins, including measurements and species details.

#### Sample Rows:

A glimpse into the initial rows of the dataset reveals a structured arrangement of data, providing a clear overview of the available information. These observations serve as the foundation for the subsequent R code and visualizations, offering a rich dataset for in-depth analysis.

#### Key Attributes:

- Species Details: The dataset captures distinctive features of different penguin species, enabling a thorough examination of species-specific traits and behaviors.
- Measurements: Precise measurements such as flipper length and body mass offer quantitative insights into the physical characteristics of individual penguins.
- Categorical Information: Beyond numerical data, categorical variables like sex and species facilitate nuanced explorations, allowing for detailed comparisons and pattern identification.
